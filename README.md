# Decision_tree
Data Background
The Universal Bank dataset contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer’s relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan).
This assignment involves creating a decision tree model using the Universal Bank dataset to predict whether a new customer will accept a loan offer. The findings will guide the design of a new marketing campaign.
Steps to Follow:
1.	Data Preprocessing:
o	Perform label encoding for both the predictor and target variables.
o	Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
2.	Building the Model:
o	Construct a decision tree model using the training set.
3.	Model Evaluation:
o	Evaluate the decision tree’s performance on the test set using:
	Accuracy score
	Confusion matrix
	Feature importance analysis
	Visualization of the decision tree
	ROC curve and AUC (Area Under the Curve)
Key Skills Demonstrated:
1.	Data preprocessing (label encoding, train-test split).
2.	Building decision tree models using appropriate algorithms.
3.	Evaluating and interpreting model performance with metrics and visual tools.
Tools Required:
•	Pandas (for data manipulation).
•	Scikit-learn (for building and evaluating the decision tree model).
